## Getting Set Up

1. I'm assuming you have [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) installed.
2. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). We will use this to run Phi-3 locally.
3. Open a command prompt and run `ollama pull phi3:latest` to download Phi-3
4. Validate everything is working by using `ollama run phi3` after the download is complete.
